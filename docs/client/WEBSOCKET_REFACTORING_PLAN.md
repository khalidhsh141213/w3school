This document outlines the step-by-step plan for refactoring all WebSocket connections in the Trading App to use the centralized WebSocketManager.

## Progress So Far

We have successfully refactored the following key components to use the WebSocketManager:

1. `pages/trading.tsx` - Main trading page
2. `components/layout/MarketTicker.tsx` - Market data ticker
3. `components/watchlist/WatchlistTable.tsx` - Watchlist table
4. `pages/dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard page
5. `pages/assets.tsx` - Asset list page

These refactorings have demonstrated several benefits:

- Reduced code size by eliminating redundant connection management logic
- Improved reliability with centralized reconnection and error handling
- Better resource management with proper cleanup on component unmount
- Consistent connection management patterns across the application

## Remaining Components to Update

Based on the analysis from our automation scripts, the following components still require updates:

### High Priority (Week 1)

1. ✅ `pages/dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard page
2. ✅ `pages/assets.tsx` - Asset list page
3. `pages/trade.tsx` - Trading page
4. `pages/trading-dashboard.tsx` - Alternative trading dashboard
5. `pages/trading-improved.tsx` - Improved trading page

### Medium Priority (Week 2)

6. `pages/discover.tsx` - Asset discovery page
7. `pages/copy-trading.tsx` - Copy trading functionality
8. `components/dashboard/MarketOverview.tsx` - Market overview component
9. `components/trading/PositionsList.tsx` - Positions list component
10. `components/trading/OrderBook.tsx` - Order book component

### Lower Priority (Week 3)

11. `components/charts/LiveChart.tsx` - Live chart component
12. `components/portfolio/PortfolioPerformance.tsx` - Portfolio performance component
13. `hooks/use-market-data.ts` - Market data hook
14. `hooks/use-portfolio-data.ts` - Portfolio data hook
15. `hooks/use-order-stream.ts` - Order stream hook

## Refactoring Approach

For each component, follow these steps:

1. **Analysis**

   - Read the component to understand its WebSocket usage
   - Identify all WebSocket connections, event handlers, and subscriptions
   - Document the connection URLs, message formats, and subscription patterns

2. **Refactoring**

   - Import the WebSocketManager: `import { useWebSocket, ConnectionStatus } from '@/services/WebSocketManager'`
   - Replace direct WebSocket initialization with the useWebSocket hook
   - Replace event handlers with subscribe callbacks
   - Replace manual send calls with the WebSocketManager send method
   - Update UI status indicators to use ConnectionStatus enum
   - Remove manual reconnection logic
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly included in useEffect dependencies

3. **Testing**
   - Verify the component connects to the WebSocket endpoint
   - Test subscription behavior with multiple symbols
   - Validate reconnection behavior by simulating disconnections
   - Ensure proper cleanup when the component unmounts
   - Confirm memory usage is stable over time

## Automation Strategy

To streamline the process, we'll enhance the existing automation script:

1. **Improve Detection**

   - Update `identify-websocket-usage.js` to classify components by refactoring difficulty
   - Add detailed reporting of WebSocket usage patterns

2. **Create Transformation Script**

   - Enhance `update-components.js` to automatically replace basic WebSocket patterns
   - Add support for common subscription patterns
   - Implement automatic import updates

3. **Testing Automation**
   - Create a script to validate WebSocket behavior after refactoring
   - Implement automated connection testing for critical components

## Timeline

### Week 1 (Days 1-5)

- Days 1-2: Complete high-priority page components (dashboard.tsx, assets.tsx)
- Days 3-4: Complete remaining high-priority components (trade.tsx, trading-dashboard.tsx, trading-improved.tsx)
- Day 5: Testing and verification of high-priority components

### Week 2 (Days 6-10)

- Days 6-7: Complete medium-priority page components (discover.tsx, copy-trading.tsx)
- Days 8-9: Complete medium-priority UI components (MarketOverview.tsx, PositionsList.tsx, OrderBook.tsx)
- Day 10: Testing and verification of medium-priority components

### Week 3 (Days 11-15)

- Days 11-12: Complete lower-priority components (LiveChart.tsx, PortfolioPerformance.tsx)
- Days 13-14: Complete hook refactoring (use-market-data.ts, use-portfolio-data.ts, use-order-stream.ts)
- Day 15: Final testing, documentation updates, and performance verification

## Verification Strategy

After completing each batch of refactoring, perform these verification steps:

1. **Functionality Testing**

   - Verify each component still receives and processes WebSocket messages correctly
   - Confirm UI updates properly when new data arrives
   - Test subscription management when component props change

2. **Error Handling**

   - Simulate connection failures and verify recovery
   - Test behavior when invalid messages are received
   - Confirm error states are properly displayed in the UI

3. **Performance Verification**
   - Monitor memory usage over time to detect potential leaks
   - Verify CPU usage during high message throughput
   - Test with multiple components active simultaneously

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                   | Mitigation                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Breaking existing functionality        | Comprehensive testing after each component update      |
| Memory leaks from incomplete cleanup   | Verify cleanup functions in all useEffect hooks        |
| Connection limit issues                | Test with multiple components active simultaneously    |
| Reconnection storms                    | Implement connection rate limiting in WebSocketManager |
| Data inconsistency during reconnection | Add message sequence tracking                          |

## Additional Improvements

While refactoring, we'll also implement these enhancements:

1. **Heartbeat Mechanism**

   - Add ping/pong logic to detect stale connections
   - Implement automatic reconnection for inactive connections

2. **Subscription Optimization**

   - Add subscription deduplication to prevent duplicate requests
   - Implement subscription batching for better performance

3. **Connection Status Monitoring**
   - Create a global connection status indicator
   - Add connection quality metrics
   - Implement automatic reconnection retry backoff

## Conclusion

This phased approach will allow us to systematically refactor all WebSocket connections in the Trading App to use the centralized WebSocketManager. By prioritizing components based on visibility and complexity, we can deliver incremental improvements while maintaining application stability.

Upon completion, we'll have a more robust, maintainable WebSocket infrastructure with consistent patterns across the entire application, reducing code duplication and improving reliability.
