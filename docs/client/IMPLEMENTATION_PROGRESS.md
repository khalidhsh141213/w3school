### In Progress

#### Core Infrastructure

- ðŸ”„ API client with standardized error handling
- ðŸ”„ State management refactoring with context API
- ðŸ”„ Component consolidation (OrderForm, MarketData, Dashboard, etc.)
- ðŸ”„ State management implementation
- ðŸ”„ Integration of API client with existing components
- ðŸ”„ Error handling improvements across the application

#### Component Consolidation

- ðŸ”„ Consolidating OrderForm component
- ðŸ”„ Consolidating MarketData component
- ðŸ”„ Updating import references to use new consolidated components

### Not Started

#### Component Consolidation

- â¬œ Consolidate Dashboard component
- â¬œ Consolidate PortfolioSummary component
- â¬œ Consolidate TradingHistory component

#### Performance Optimization

- â¬œ Implement memoization for expensive computations
- â¬œ Add pagination for large data sets
- â¬œ Optimize rendering of frequently updated components

## Next Steps

1. Complete the API client implementation
2. Finish consolidating remaining duplicate components
3. Update all imports to reference the new consolidated components
4. Implement proper error handling throughout the application
5. Add comprehensive testing for all components
6. Optimize performance for large data sets and frequent updates
7. Consider implementing WebSocket fallback mechanisms for environments without WebSocket support
8. WebSocket fallback mechanism implementation
9. Performance optimizations (memoization, virtualization)
10. User preferences persistence
11. Pagination for large datasets
12. Theme support implementation
13. Localization & internationalization
14. Automated testing setup
15. CI/CD pipeline configuration
