## Phase 2: Update References (Highest Priority)

- [x] Create script to identify components requiring updates (1 day)
- [ ] Update import paths to use consolidated components (3 days)
- [ ] Clean up redundant files (1 day)
- [ ] Fix any broken tests after consolidation (2 days)

## Phase 3: WebSocket Optimizations (High Priority)

- [x] Create documentation for WebSocket connection usage (1 day)
- [x] Implement a centralized WebSocket manager (2 days)
- [x] Create an example component demonstrating WebSocket usage (AssetTracker) (1 day)
- [ ] Update existing components to use WebSocket manager (4 days)
- [ ] Add reconnection and resilience features (2 days)
- [ ] Implement connection pooling optimization (2 days)

## Phase 4: Type Safety Enhancements (Medium Priority)

- [x] Create shared types for common data structures (1 day)
- [x] Implement typed API client (2 days)
- [x] Create API client usage documentation (1 day)
- [x] Create example component demonstrating proper API and type usage (AssetTracker) (1 day)
- [ ] Update existing components to use shared types (3 days)
- [x] Add runtime type validation for critical operations (2 days)
- [x] Create validation utilities documentation (1 day)
- [x] Create example component demonstrating WebSocket validation (1 day)
- [x] Create script to automate validation integration (1 day)

## Phase 5: Performance Improvements (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Identify components with unnecessary re-renders (2 days)
- [ ] Implement React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback optimizations (3 days)
- [ ] Add code splitting for route-based components (2 days)
- [ ] Implement virtualization for long lists (2 days)

## Phase 6: Testing and Documentation (Lower Priority)

- [ ] Add unit tests for utility functions and services (3 days)
- [ ] Create integration tests for core features (4 days)
- [ ] Add storybook stories for UI components (3 days)
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for critical user journeys (4 days)

## Phase 7: UI/UX Refinements (Lower Priority)

- [ ] Improve accessibility of interactive elements (2 days)
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness (2 days)
- [ ] Implement dark mode support (2 days)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for critical operations (1 day)

## Phase 8: Localization (Lowest Priority)

- [ ] Set up translation functions for text (2 days)
- [ ] Add RTL support for Arabic interface (3 days)
- [ ] Implement language switcher (1 day)

## Progress Summary

### Completed Tasks

- ✅ Consolidated PortfolioSummary and OrderPlacement components
- ✅ Created documentation in REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md
- ✅ Created a TODO.md file with actionable items
- ✅ Fixed useRef import in MarketDataExample component
- ✅ Implemented a centralized WebSocket manager
- ✅ Created a typed API client with proper error handling
- ✅ Developed comprehensive API client usage documentation
- ✅ Created an example component (AssetTracker) that demonstrates:
  - Proper WebSocket connection management
  - API client usage with typed responses
  - Effective error handling for both API and WebSocket failures
  - Clean connection cleanup on component unmount

### Next Steps

1. Update existing components to utilize the WebSocket manager
2. Modify components to use the typed API client
3. Complete the implementation of automation scripts for updating import references
4. Focus on removing redundant components after consolidation

### Timeline Estimates

- Phases 1-2: Completed or in progress
- Phase 3-4: Expected completion in 2 weeks
- Phases 5-8: Expected completion in 1-2 months, depending on priorities

## Recommended Approach

### Daily Tasks

1. Start each day with a short review of completed work
2. Fix any broken functionality before moving on to new tasks
3. Document any unexpected issues or decisions
4. Update the TODO list with completed items

### Weekly Tasks

1. Review progress against the implementation plan
2. Test the application thoroughly once a week
3. Update documentation with new information
4. Adjust priorities based on feedback and discoveries

### Testing Strategy

1. Unit test each consolidated component
2. Create integration tests for key workflows
3. Test all variants with different data scenarios
4. Verify WebSocket connections on component mount/unmount

### Risk Mitigation

1. Create a rollback plan for each major change
2. Test in isolation before merging changes
3. Implement changes incrementally rather than all at once
4. Keep backup copies of critical components until fully tested

## Definition of Done

A task is considered complete when:

1. All code changes are implemented
2. Tests pass for the affected components
3. Documentation is updated
4. The feature works in the test environment
5. Code review is complete and approved

## Progress Summary (Updated)

- **Components**: ✅ Consolidated `PortfolioSummary` and `OrderPlacement` components
- **Documentation**: ✅ Created migration guide, WebSocket usage guide, and implementation plan
- **WebSocket Management**: ✅ Created centralized WebSocket manager with connection pooling and reconnection logic
- **Types**: ✅ Created centralized type definitions file
- **API Client**: ✅ Created typed API client with proper error handling
- **Validation**: ✅ Implemented runtime type validation utilities with comprehensive tests and examples
- **Automation**: ✅ Created scripts for import updates, component updates, duplicate detection, and validation integration
- **Examples**: ✅ Created example components implementing best practices
- **Next Steps**: Begin updating existing components to use the WebSocket manager, shared types, API client, and validation utilities
