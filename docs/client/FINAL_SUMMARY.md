   - ✅ Added README with project overview

2. **Planning Documents**
   - ✅ Created implementation plan
   - ✅ Created TODO list
   - ✅ Created completion checklist
   - ✅ Created progress tracking document

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority

1. **Code Integration**

   - Run the refactoring scripts on the entire codebase
   - Update all components to use the consolidated infrastructure
   - Ensure proper cleanup of WebSocket connections

2. **Testing**

   - Add unit tests for consolidated components
   - Create integration tests for critical workflows
   - Add better test coverage for edge cases

3. **Performance**
   - Identify and fix unnecessary re-renders
   - Implement memoization where appropriate
   - Add code splitting for route-based components

### Medium Priority

1. **Documentation**

   - Create Storybook examples
   - Document project structure
   - Create a code style guide

2. **Infrastructure Enhancements**

   - Add request interceptors for authentication
   - Implement a heartbeat mechanism for WebSocket
   - Add circuit breaker pattern for API and WebSocket failures

3. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios
   - Add ARIA labels to all interactive elements
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works for all components

### Low Priority

1. **Localization**

   - Wrap text in translation functions
   - Create translation files
   - Add RTL support

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement offline support
   - Add progressive enhancement
   - Create advanced performance monitoring

## Next Steps

To fully realize the benefits of the refactoring work, we recommend the following next steps:

1. **Run the Master Refactoring Script**

   ```bash
   node scripts/refactor-codebase.js --dry-run
   ```

   Review the output and then run without the `--dry-run` flag when satisfied.

2. **Manual Review and Testing**
   Test the application thoroughly to ensure nothing was broken during the refactoring process.

3. **Prioritize Remaining Tasks**
   Focus on the high-priority tasks first, particularly updating the existing components to use the new infrastructure.

## Conclusion

The Trading App refactoring has established a solid foundation for ongoing development. The core infrastructure components (API client, WebSocket manager, and validation utilities) provide a robust and type-safe framework for building reliable features.

The example components and documentation serve as a guide for best practices, and the automation tools make it easier to maintain consistency across the codebase. With these improvements in place, the Trading App is positioned for improved maintainability, better performance, and a more consistent user experience.
