  - Added support for WebSocket-based real-time updates
  - Standardized the data structure interface
  - Improved error handling and loading states
  - Used conditional rendering based on the variant prop

### 2. OrderPlacement Component

- **Consolidated Components**:
  - `components/trading/OrderPlacement.tsx`
  - `components/trading/OrderPlacementImproved.tsx`
- **Improvements**:
  - Enhanced validation with Zod schema
  - Better error messages and user feedback
  - Added percentage-based quick quantity selection
  - Improved UI with cleaner layout and better tooltips
  - Added warnings for insufficient balance

### 3. UI Components

- **Alert Components**:
  - Consolidated `alert.tsx` and `alert-dialog.tsx` functionalities
  - Ensured consistent styling and behavior

## Data Management Improvements

### 1. API Integration

- **Standardized API Requests**:
  - Created consistent error handling patterns
  - Implemented proper loading states for all data fetching operations
  - Centralized API endpoint configuration

### 2. State Management

- **Custom Hooks**:
  - Created reusable data hooks like `usePortfolioData`
  - Implemented shared caching strategies
  - Added proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### 3. WebSocket Connection Handling

- **Connection Management**:
  - Implemented proper connection cleanup on component unmount
  - Added event listener management with cleanup
  - Improved error handling for WebSocket failures
  - Used reference tracking to manage component lifecycle

## Structural Improvements

1. **Reduced Duplication**

   - Consolidated duplicate components
   - Standardized API response handling
   - Unified styling and behavior patterns

2. **Better Type Safety**

   - Consistent interfaces across components
   - Improved type definitions for portfolio data
   - Better error handling for API responses

3. **Improved Performance**

   - Optimized WebSocket subscription management
   - Reduced unnecessary re-renders
   - Better cleanup on component unmount

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added graceful degradation for failed data operations
   - Improved user feedback for error states
   - Created better loading indicators for async operations

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Update Import Paths**

   - Some imports may still reference old component paths
   - Systematic update needed throughout the codebase

2. **Remove Redundant Files**

   - Further analysis of unused components or services
   - Potential consolidation of additional UI components

3. **Testing**

   - Test new component variants for proper rendering
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Verify all functionality works as expected

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for component variants
   - Document WebSocket connection patterns
   - Update API integration documentation

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**

   - Fewer files to maintain
   - Consistent behavior across the application

2. **Improved Organization**

   - Logical component grouping
   - Clear separation of concerns

3. **Better Developer Experience**

   - Easier to find and reuse components
   - Better documentation
   - More consistent patterns

4. **Performance Improvement**

   - Smaller bundle sizes due to less duplicate code
   - More efficient use of React's rendering system
   - Better WebSocket connection management
   - Improved resource cleanup

5. **Enhanced Reliability**
   - More consistent error handling
   - Better type safety
   - Improved edge case handling
   - Proper connection lifecycle management

  - Added improved validation for leverage and trade amount
  - Enhanced error feedback and user warnings
  - Standardized prop interface with better typing

### Infrastructure Improvements

#### WebSocket Management

- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Description**: Created a centralized WebSocket manager for better connection handling.
- **Details**:
  - Implemented as a singleton to prevent duplicate connections
  - Added proper connection pooling and resource management
  - Created cleanup mechanisms for unmounting components
  - Added reconnection and error handling strategies
  - Documentation available in separate WebSocket usage guide

#### Typed API Client

- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Description**: Implemented a comprehensive typed API client for all backend interactions.
